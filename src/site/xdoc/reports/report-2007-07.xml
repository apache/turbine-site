<section name="Apache Turbine Project Board report, July 2007">

<subsection name="Status">

<p>TLP migration is mostly done. The largest outstanding issue is to migrate our
 download pages over from Jakarta. Other than this development activity has been
 very low this month.</p>
<p>The most immediate challenge we have is addressing the requirement to
 register Turbine's cryptographic capabilities as per
 http://apache.org/dev/crypto (ECCN codes). This was mentioned on last month's
 report, but a query via the dev list has put pressure on us to action this.</p>
<p>We have no board-level issues at this time.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Community changes">

<p>No new committers were voted in since the last board report.</p>
<p>No new PMC members were voted in since the last board report.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Turbine core project">

<p>No major activity this month. Further work on localization is being discussed
 and the ECCN code issue mentioned above came up.</p>
<p>No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Fulcrum component project">

<p>No major activity this month. A minor build problem relating to the
 redirection from jakarta to turbine has been identified and will no doubt be
 fixed in less time than it has taken me to write this sentence.</p>
<p>No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.</p>
