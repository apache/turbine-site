<section name="Apache Turbine Project Board Report, May 2008">

<subsection name="Status">

<p>The Turbine project continues on with its usual fairly low level of
activity. This quarter there was a burst of activity from those present
at ApacheCon eu.</p>
<p>The Turbine project has no board-level issues at this time.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Community changes">

<p>No new committers were voted in since the last board report.</p>
<p>No new PMC members were voted in since the last board report.</p>

<subsection name="Turbine core project">

<p>There has been quite a bit of progress towards Turbine 2.3.3:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Thomas Vandahl has added l10n support to the ParameterParser
(cleaning up the code quite a bit in the process) and integrated this
into the Intake validation service. In the process of doing this Thomas
has removed a few undesirable service interdependencies, thus resolving
a long standing stumbling block on our quest to separate the services
out of turbine core.</li>
  <li>Dependency versions have been updated.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2.3.3 release is now pretty much ready to go. Thomas Vandahl is
mentoring Juergen Hoffmann through the release process.</p>
<p>Discussion on the naming of a future trunk release has been kicked off.
The possibility of jumping to "Turbine 4" is being considered.</p>
<p>Henning stopped by and committed a DOAP file for the Turbine project.</p>
<p>No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Fulcrum component project">

<p>Siegfried Goeschl continues to commit tweaks to the fulcrum components
as well as some work on migrating the build process to Maven 2. Thomas
has also been maintaining fulcrum components in parallel with the
equivalent changes to turbine core.</p>
<p>No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.</p>
