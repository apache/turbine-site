<subsection name="Fulcrum component project">

<p>
The release candidate of fulcrum-yaafi-1.0.5 is slightly broken due to
 incompatible changes of the JAMon library (used for intercepting the Avalon
 services calls to measure the execution times). The main problem is the tight
 coupling between the Avalon container and the various interceptor services
 which is also the driving force for refactoring. The target of the
 refactoring is to have a package with the interceptor logic which can be
 released/updated independent from the container.</p>
<p>No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.</p>
