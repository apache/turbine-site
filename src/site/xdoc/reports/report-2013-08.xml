<section name="Apache Turbine Project Board Report, August 2013">

<p>Apache Turbine is a servlet based framework that allows experienced Java 
developers to quickly build web applications. Turbine allows you to use personalize
the web sites and to use user logins to restrict access to parts of your application.</p>
<p>Turbine is a matured and well established framework that is used as the base of 
many other projects.</p>

<subsection name="Status">

<p>The Turbine project has as usual seen low levels of activity in
the last quarter.</p>
<p>The Turbine project has no board-level issues at this time.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Project Branding Board Report Checklist">

<p>The last issue left is
<ul>
<li>TODO: Logos and Graphics : include TM</li>
</ul>
</p>

</subsection>
<subsection name="Community changes">

<p>No new committers were voted in since the last board report.</p>
<p>The last change to the committer base was the addition of Georg Kallidis (2012/09/19)</p>
<p>No new PMC members were voted in since the last board report.</p>
<p>The last change to the PMC was the resignation of Henning Schmiedehausen in 2010</p>

<subsection name="Turbine core project">

<p>The Turbine core project proceeds slowly to the next milestone 
release which shall include a modified security implementation and 
support for the Quartz scheduler to replace the built-in one.</p>
<p>The last released components were the Maven archetypes and the parent POM (2012/11/18)</p>
<p>We are still waiting for Infra to switch our site to svnpubsub. The issue 
INFRA-5685 is open. This is a bit unfortunate because we fixed the JavaDoc security 
issues in the new site and cannot publish it.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Fulcrum component project">

<p>There has been no activity on the Fulcrum sub-project in this quarter.</p>
<p>The last released component was fulcrum-upload 1.0.5 (2012/08/09)</p>
