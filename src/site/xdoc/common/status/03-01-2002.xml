  <section name="Turbine 2.2">
     <p>
       As it stands the last issue to deal with is making Fulcrum work
       with Turbine 2.2. I will start dealing with this issue on Wednesday
       building on what Martin has started and we are going to aim for
       a beta within two weeks. Martin will continue working on Torque
       so that by the time the beta rolls around Torque and Fulcrum will
       be working well with Turbine 2.2. So we'll shoot for the 18th of
       March.

   <section name="Progress on Maven">
     <p>
       This is where most of the action is happening this week. The
       documentation system is looking great, Jeff and Pete have tried
       using Maven on a couple of small projects with success and we
       hope to be able to use Maven for all the Turbine projects in the
       next two weeks.
