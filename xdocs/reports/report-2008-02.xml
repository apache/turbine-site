<section name="Apache Turbine Project Board Report, February 2008">

<subsection name="Status">

<p>There has been good progress towards resolving the outstanding ECCN issues
 within the Turbine project. See below for details.</p>
<p>The final tasks relating to Turbine becoming a TLP have finally been
 completed - the mirrored downloads and archived releases have been moved from
 jakarta to turbine directories.</p>
<p>Other than this the Turbine project continues on with a fairly low level of
 activity.</p>
<p>The Turbine project has no board-level issues at this time.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="ECCN Status and activity">

<p>While this issue has been highlighted by Bill for the current round of
 reports, it has been on our radar for some time now.</p>
<p>The following areas had the potential to require ECCN registration due to
 their use of a "symmetric algorithm employing a key length exceeding 56 bits"
 and/or because they "were designed to work with strong cryptographic
 libraries":</p>
<ol>
  <li>fulcrum-crypto - used the cryptix library to implement Unix crypt()</li>
  <li>The Crypto Service in Turbine Core, from which fulcrum-crypto was
   extracted - also used the cryptix library</li>
  <li>fulcrum-yaafi - supports decryption of strongly encrypted configuration
   files</li>
  <li>fulcrum-pbe - supports strong encryption/decryption of files</li>
</ol>
<p>In particular, the following actions have taken place:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the cryptix dependency has been removed from fulcrum-crypto and Turbine
   core's Crypto Service (replaced with
   org.apache.jetspeed.services.security.ldap.UnixCrypt from the JetSpeed Portal
   project).</li>
  <li>the exposed interfaces and underlying implementation of fulcrum-yaafi and
   fulcrum-pbe have been modified to ensure that only DES (56 bit key length)
   can be used (strong encryption was never used but was available through the
   exposed interfaces).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is our understanding that after our next release of the following
 components, no aspects of the Apache Turbine project will require ECCN
 registration:</p>
<ul>
  <li>fulcrum-crypto-1.0.7 - ETA some time in the next few weeks</li>
  <li>turbine-2.3.3 - ETA some time in the next month or so</li>
  <li>fulcrum-yaafi-1.0.6 - ETA some time in the next few weeks</li>
  <li>fulcrum-pbe-1.0.0 - Not yet a released component so no release required in
   order to comply.</li>
</ul>

<subsection name="Community changes">

<p>No new committers were voted in since the last board report.</p>
<p>No new PMC members were voted in since the last board report.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Turbine core project">

<p>The Turbine Core trunk and turbine-site modules have been updated to ASL 2.0
 - this was long overdue and is in preparation for a future release.</p>
<p>The changes to fulcrum-crypto have been backported to the Crypto Service so
 as to eliminate the ECCN registration requirement for Turbine core.</p>
<p>We are working on releasing Turbine 2.3.3 - this has primarily been waiting
 on the DB Project's Torque 3.3 release which is likely to appear in the next
 couple of weeks.</p>
<p>No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Fulcrum component project">

<p>Mostly ECCN related activity, but progress on migrating from Maven 1.x to
 Maven 2.x for project builds has commenced.</p>
<p>No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.</p>
