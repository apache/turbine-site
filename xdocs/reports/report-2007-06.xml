<section name="Apache Turbine Project Board report for June 2007">

<subsection name="Status">

<p>The new Turbine TLP is progressing well.  The new site has been set up and
 the mailing lists and associated archives have been migrated.  There are still
 a number of tasks outstanding in order to complete the migration from Jakarta
 and these are progressing at a steady pace with the assistance of
 Infrastructure.</p>
<p>Other than this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The source headers have been updated in all sub-projects likely to see
  a release in the near future.</li>
<li>Migration of the build system from Maven 1 to Maven 2 is being
 considered.</li>
<li>Issues concerning the possible requirement to register Turbine's
 cryptographic capabilities as per http://apache.org/dev/crypto now falls to the
 new Turbine PMC, we will try and address this once the TLP migration is
 complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have no board-level issues at this time. </p>

<p>No beta or final releases have been made in the recent past however a fixes
 and enhancements to the 2.3 branch of the project are continuing at a steady
 pace.  Planning for a 2.3.3 release is underway, but will most likely be held
 off until version 3.3 of DB Torque is released. </p>
<p>The source headers for the turbine-2 trunk are yet to be updated (this
 includes META).</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Fulcrum component project">

<ul>
<li>the source headers have been updated for the whole Fulcrum project.</li>
<li>all build issues were fixed (can we name that "build wrestling"?!).</li>
<li>a up-to-date Fulcrum site was uploaded to http://turbine.apache.org/fulcrum/</li>
<li>the dependency convergence report looks okayish - need to release
 fulcrum-security and fulcrum-upload to fix it completely.</li>
<li>release of fulcrum-yaafi-1.0.5 is currently prepared.</li>
</ul>
