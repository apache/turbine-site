<section name="Apache Turbine Project Board report, November 2007">

<subsection name="Status">

<p>There has been some progress on the ECCN issue - the fulcrum
 components are now in good shape, but some recent changes there
 need to be back-ported to turbine core and a release made
 before we send the ECCN notification.</p>
<p>We have no board-level issues at this time.</p>

<subsection name="Community changes">

</subsection>

<subsection name="Turbine core project">

<p>No major activity this month, but the changes made in the
 pending fulcrum-crypto-1.0.6 release need to be back-ported to
 the components currently integrated in turbine core (head and
 maintenance branches).</p>
<p>No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Fulcrum component project">

<p>Work was put into eliminating dependencies with the
 potential to complicate tidying up the ECCN compliance.</p>
<p>Releases since the last board report:</p>
<ul>
<li>fulcrum-yaafi-1.0.5 was released on 2007-10-03.</li>
<li>fulcrum-crypto-1.0.6 has been cut and the release
 vote passed on 2007-11-06 - final deployment is pending.</li>
