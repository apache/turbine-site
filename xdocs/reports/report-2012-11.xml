<section name="Apache Turbine Project Board Report, November 2012">

<p>Apache Turbine is a servlet based framework that allows experienced Java 
developers to quickly build web applications. Turbine allows you to use personalize
the web sites and to use user logins to restrict access to parts of your application.</p>
<p>Turbine is a matured and well established framework that is used as the base of 
many other projects.</p>

<subsection name="Status">

<p>The Turbine project has as usual seen low levels of activity in
the last quarter.</p>
<p>The Turbine project has no board-level issues at this time.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Project Branding Board Report Checklist">

<p>The last issue left is
<ul>
<li>TODO: Logos and Graphics : include TM</li>
</ul>
</p>

</subsection>
<subsection name="Community changes">

<p>Georg Kallidis has been voted in as a Turbine Committer.</p>
<p>No new PMC members were voted in since the last board report.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Turbine core project">

<p>The Turbine core project proceeds slowly to the next milestone 
release which shall include a modified security implementation and 
support for the Quartz scheduler to replace the built-in one.</p>
<p>Due to unexpected problems with the release of a Fulcrum component 
(the previous method of mirroring the M2 repository on people.a.o 
does no longer work), we found the need to create a new Parent POM 
for the project that uses Nexus. As this is a substantial change in 
the organization of the Turbine core project and the Fulcrum components 
a full vote is being held.</p>
<p>Two other votes are open
<ul>
<li>Maven Archetype for a Turbine 2.3.3 web application</li>
<li>Maven Archetype for a Turbine 4.0 web application (based on Turbine 4.0M1)</li>
</ul>
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Fulcrum component project">

<p>The Fulcrum security components are being prepared to be included 
in the Turbine 4.0M2 release. Several other Fulcrum components have 
been updated and will be released subsequently, once the new Parent POM is released.</p>
<p>- fulcrum-upload, version 1.0.5 has been released.</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="META project">

<p>There has been no activity on the META sub-project in this quarter. 
The sub-project will be closed down when the two archetypes have passed 
their vote. We are planning not to report on this sub-project anymore 
starting from the next board report.</p>
<p>No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.</p>
