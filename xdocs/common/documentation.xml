<section name="The Turbine Documentation Effort">

  <subsection name="Documentation Roadmap">
<p>
      We are working very hard to improve Turbine's documentation.  Our weakest
      area is introductory material for new users.  Currently, the best resource
      is the turbine-user mailing list.  Although almost every question has
      clear answers found in the list archives, it is time-consuming to find them.
</p>

<p>
      Below is the list of documentation items we are working on listed in order
      of priority from greatest to lowest.  We need help with them all!
</p>

<ul>

      <li>
        <b>Turbine 2.3 Release Changes</b>
        <ul>

        </ul>

  <subsection name="Our Documentation Has Three States">
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Infancy:</strong>  A document becomes nascent in the Wiki
        as an empty or sparsely populated page.  At this point, people continue to
        add and revise the content until it becomes mostly stable and unchanging.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stability:</strong>  Once the document has reached a stable point, it is converted into the xdoc
        format and injected into the site or core modules at the subversion repository.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Maturity:</strong>   As changes to the Turbine Framework are made, the documentation
        is updated and improved via xdoc patches from the <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TRB">bug tracker</a>.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </subsection>

  <subsection name="How You Can Help">
<p>
      Now that you know what we are working on, you need to know the best ways to help.
      Content is farmed and stabilized on the <a href="wiki.html">Turbine Wiki</a>
      until it is stable enough to become official documentation.  Additionally 
      questions are answered and re-answered on the turbine-user mailing list.  
      You can help the Turbine Documentation effort by:
</p>
<ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Editing The Wiki Content:</strong> Mature and stabilize the information on the <a href="wiki.html">Wiki</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Filtering The Mailing List:</strong> When you see something float
        by on the mailing list that should become part of the official,
        please convert it into the appropriate xdoc format and submit it as an
        issue in our <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TRB">issue tracking system</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Creating Xdoc Patches:</strong> If you find a typo, mistake or
        overlooked information in the official documentation, please create
        an issue in our <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TRB">issue bug tracking system</a>.
</li>
</ul>

  <subsection name="Getting The Documentation Source And Making A Patch">
    <ol>
      <li>
<p>
          <strong>Get The Source:</strong>
          Check out the latest source from the Turbine subversion module. You can learn
          about the Jakarta repositories <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/cvsindex.html">here</a>.
          The Turbine documentation resides in the jakarta/turbine/site tree:
</p>
        <source><![CDATA[svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/turbine/site]]></source>
      </li>
      <li>
<p>
          <strong>Build The Site:</strong>
          The documenation is built using <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>,
          with the following command:
</p>
        <source><![CDATA[maven site:generate]]></source>

<p>
          Afterwards, you should get something like:
</p>
        <source><![CDATA[BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time:  20 seconds]]></source>

<p>
          You will find the built HTML in $PATH_TO_MODULE/target/docs.
</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Make Your Changes:</strong>
        The docs are written using the Anakia Xdoc format, which you can learn about <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/jakarta-site-tags.html">here</a>.
        The source files are found in the $PATH_TO_MODULE/xdocs directory, each xml file corresponding to the generated html file.
        Menu information is found in the navigation.xml files.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Make A Patch:</strong>
        <source><![CDATA[svn diff  > name_of_patch.patch]]></source>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Submit Your Changes:</strong> 
          If you have a patch, log in to our <a
          href="http://issues.apache.org//jira/browse/TRB">issue tracker</a> 
          and create a new issue.A project committer will
          approve the patch and apply it, or let you know if something
          should be changed.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Thank you for helping out!</strong></li>
