  <section name="Turbine 2.2">
     <p>
       We are prepared for the release of Turbine 2.2 Beta 1 on Monday.
       Eric and Martin have the new ComponentLoader working so that Torque
       and Fulcrum are loaded in the same consistent way in Turbine 2.

   <section name="Maven">
     <p>
       We know have all of the Turbine project working with Maven. We have
       installers for Maven that can be found 
       <a href="http://www.apache.org/~jvanzyl/maven/">here</a> and the
       Turbine sites produced by Maven can be viewed
       <a href="http://www.apache.org/~jvanzyl/tsite/">here</a>.

   <section name="Turbine 3.0">
     <p>
       I am late with the roadmap for Turbine 3.0 as the release of Turbine
       2.2 takes precedence but when the 2.2 Beta 1 release cycle is complete
       I will go back to finishing off the roadmap for 3.0.
