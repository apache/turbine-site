   <section name="New Committers">
     <p>
       Pete Kazmier was added as a new committer this week. Pete has been
       doing tons of great documentation work, most notably in Torque and Stratum.
       The documentation is greatly appreciated by all users so many thanks
       to Pete! Welcome aboard!
     </p>

     <p>
       Jauncarlo Arnez was added as a committer to work on Maven. Jaunco
       donated a JavaCC-based RCS ,v file parser so that we can add CVS
       log file analysis and continuous integration tools to Maven. Thanks
       Jaunco!
     </p>

     <p>
       Tom Copeland was added as a committer to work on Maven. Tom donated
       importscrubber to Maven which is a tool that fully qualifies the import
       statements in Java source files. The guts behind this tool is
       dependency resolving mechanism that works on Java bytecode. We would
       like to use this method to automatically resolve project dependencies
       so that project descriptors with full dependencies can be made quickly
       by projects wishing to work with Maven. Thanks Tom!
     </p>

     <p>
       Stephane Baillinez was added as a new committer to work on Maven.
       Stephane is an Ant developer, works on the Ant version of Gump and
       has already sent more patches than I can deal with :-)
     </p>

   <section name="Progress on JCS">
    <p>
      Aaron and James have been refactoring some of the code and cleaning up
      the tests. John McNally is also starting to look at how to integrate
      JCS with Torque for object caching.
    </p>
   </section>

   <section name="Progress on Maven">
     <p>
       Maven has been coming along quite well. There is now a site to
       display what Maven can do, take a look <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">here</a>.
       In a nutshell we have:
     </p>

     <p>
       <li>The project being built from a project descriptor</li>
       <li>The project documentation being built from a project descriptor</li>
       <li>Automatic generation of a change log based on CVS output</li>
       <li>Source cross reference with links to Javadoc</li>
       <li>Source metrics</li>
     </p>

     <p>
       More information will be posted on the Turbine development list. But
       the basic upshot is that with the creation of a project descriptor you
       all the of what's listed above almost instantly.
     </p>

   <section name="Progress on Turbine 3.x">
     <p>
       Unfortunately not much went on this week with Turbine directory as
       work on Maven took priority. Hopefully the use of Maven will help a
       larger set of developers understand Turbine 3.x more quickly and
       therefore spur on the development of Turbine 3.x.
