<section name="Apache Turbine&#8482; Web Application Framework">

  <p>
    Apache Turbine&#8482; is a servlet based framework that allows experienced Java
    developers to quickly build web applications. Turbine allows you
    to use personalize the web sites and to use user logins to restrict
    access to parts of your application.
  </p>

  <p>
    Turbine is a matured and well established framework that is used as
    the base of many other projects (like e.g. the excellent <a
    href="http://portals.apache.org/jetspeed-1/">Jetspeed 1</a>
    Portals framework.
  </p>

  <p>
    Turbine is an excellent choice for developing applications that make use of a
    services-oriented architecture. Some of the functionality
    provided with Turbine includes a security management system (decoupled in Fulcrum Security), a
    scheduling service, XML-defined form validation server (Fulcrum Intake),
    and an XML-RPC service for web services.  It is a
    simple task to create new services particular to your application.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Turbine core is free of any dependency on a presentation layer
    technology. Both JavaServer Pages (JSP) and
    <a href="http://velocity.apache.org/engine/">Velocity</a> are supported
    inside Turbine.  For developers already familiar with JSP, or have
    existing JSP tag libraries, Turbine offers support for the Sun standard.
    <strong>Velocity</strong> is the favorite view technology of most users of the Turbine
    framework; try it out and see if Velocity can help you develop your
    web applications faster and work more easily with non-programming designers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Turbine is developed in an open, participatory environment and
    released under the <a href="common/license.html">Apache
    Software License</a>. Turbine is intended to be a collaboration of the
    best-of-breed developers from around the world.  We invite you to
    participate in this open development project.  To learn more about getting
    involved, <a href="how-to-help.html">look at our &quot;How to Help&quot; pages</a>.

<section name="Turbine Versions">
  <p>
    Turbine comes in two shapes which both have their advantages:

  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="turbine/turbine-2.3.3/">Turbine 2.3.3</a></strong> is 
    the version you should use when migrating from an older version of
    Turbine.  The <a href="turbine/development/turbine-2.3/">2.3 branch</a>
    of Turbine has been switched to maintenance mode, however. 
    You can download Turbine 2.3.3 from one of the 
    <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/turbine/turbine-2.3.3/">Apache Mirrors</a></li>

    <li><strong><a href="turbine/turbine-4.0/">Turbine 4.0</a></strong> should be the used, if starting a project based 
    on a release version of the Turbine framework. 
    Download it from one of the 
    <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/turbine/turbine-4.0/">Apache Mirrors</a>.
    Turbine 4.0 uses technologies like an <a href="http://avalon.apache.org/">
    Avalon-based</a> container and decoupled components from the
    <strong><a href="fulcrum/">Fulcrum</a></strong> sub-project of Turbine (most of the benefits of
    these enhancements are realized in the
    <a href="turbine/turbine-2.3.3/">2.3.3</a> release). One significant
    change in 4.0 is the introduction of a pipeline concept that allows you to define
    via an XML file all the stages for processing a request.
    It is based on the 
    <a href="turbine/turbine-4.0-M2/">Milestone Release 4.0-M2</a>, which you may
    download from one of the 
    <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/turbine/turbine-4.0-M2/">Apache Mirrors</a></li>
    
  <li><a href="turbine/development/turbine-4.1/">Turbine 4.1</a> is
    the shape of things to come...
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
</section>

<section name="Sub Projects">

<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/fulcrum/">Fulcrum</a> is by default in use since Turbine 4.x. It is a collection of services originally
    developed as part of Turbine, but now decoupled and usable in any environment
    that supports <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/excalibur/AvalonFramework">Avalon</a> components. 
  </li>
</ul>
</section>

<section name="Turbine Alumni">

<p>
 As a longtime, but now ex-member of the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">Jakarta Project</a>, 
 Turbine has influenced quite a number of projects:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://db.apache.org/torque/">Torque</a> is a persistence
    layer originally developed as part of Turbine.  Torque is now
    decoupled and part of the <a href="http://db.apache.org/">Apache Database Project</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> is an advanced Java
    Project Management tool originally developed out of the frustration with the
    Turbine build process. Maven is now a toplevel Apache project, residing at <a
    href="http://maven.apache.org/">maven.apache.org</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    In addition, Turbine has spawned a number of <a href="http://commons.apache.org/">Commons</a>
    components like <a href="http://commons.apache.org/configuration/">Commons configuration</a> or
    <a href="http://commons.apache.org/email/">Commons EMail</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
