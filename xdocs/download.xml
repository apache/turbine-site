<section name="Getting Started With Turbine">
  <p>
    Currently, the best way to get started with Turbine is to use the
    <a href="meta/">Maven Environment for Turbine Applications (M.E.T.A.)</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section name="Binary And Source Distributions">
  <p>
    If you already know how to use Turbine and simply want the latest
    binaries or source, you can get them from the
    <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/turbine">apache mirror system</a>
    in the <em>turbine</em> subdirectory.

<section name="Getting Source snapshots">
  <p>
    We provide you snapshots of all the current turbine projects. These
    are built on a daily base but are only source snapshots. There are no
    warranties that these build or run. You can get them from

<section name="Getting The Development Source From Subversion">
  <p>
    You can check out the latest source from the Turbine Subversion repository.
    Information on connecting to the ASF Subversion repositories can be found on the
    <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html">version control page</a>.
    More specific details can be found on the <em>Source Repository</em> page,
    within <em>Project Reports</em> under <em>Project Documentation</em>,

<section name="Building The Source">
  <p>
    Be sure and read the README.txt file for instructions on how to build Turbine.
    Turbine uses <a href="http://maven.apache.org/maven-1.x/">Maven</a> as its
    build system, and building is as simple as running 'maven' or 'maven jar:jar'
    at the top of the source directory.
