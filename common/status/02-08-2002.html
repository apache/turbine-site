   <section><a id="Weekly_Status_Report.3A_08_Feb_2002"></a>
<h1>Weekly Status Report: 08 Feb 2002</h1>
     
<p>
       What's going on with Turbine these days? Well, quite a lot actually. We
       were in a lull there for a while but things are back on track so I
       thought I would try and report some of the work and changes that have
       been going on recently.
     </p>
    </section>

      <section><a id="Stratum"></a>
<h1>Stratum</h1>
       
<p>
         Stratum is the repository where we are trying to refactor a lot
         of the existing Turbine code into modularized components that
         can be used across all Turbine projects. The short term goal is
         refactoring for the purpose of clarifying the code for Turbine use,
         but after this has happened the goal is to move all the code, with
         thorough units tests of course, into the commons where we can share
         our code with the Jakarta community.
       </p>

       
<p>
         There are several components in Stratum, most of the code originated
         in Turbine but there are some new additions. Here is a short run down
         of the components that will be available in Stratum:
       </p>

       
<p>
         
<li>
           Configuration: This code originated in JServ, was brought into
           Turbine, moved to Velocity and improved, and then moved
           into the Commons as ExtendedProperties. The code in
           ExtendedProperties is a little unweildly and deals specifically
           with properties files. We wanted to use a general Configuration
           interface and allow the source of the values to vary. Right now
           we only have the properties file version working, but the XML
           configuration will soon work.
         </li>
         
<li>
           Exception: This code has also wandered around a bit. It started
           in Turbine 2.x, and subsequently copied around into Torque, Fulcrum, and
           Turbine 3.x and eventually landed in the Commons Util package.
           Again we wanted to clean it up a bit, make it work consistently
           throughout the Turbine code, make sure it will interoperate with
           chainable exceptions in 1.4 and then put it back in the Commons.
         </li>
         
<li>
           Factory: This is essentially the FactoryService refactored into
           a component. It's my feeling that factories are a fundamental
           aspect of an application and not a service. The example being
           Fulcrum where dynamic classloading cannot be performed very
           easily by the FactoryService within the core service code itself.
           As a component the factory type behaviour provided can be used
           in a determined way anywhere, including the core of the Fulcrum
           service framework.
         </li>
         
<li>
           Introspection: This is the introspector that was originally written
           for Velocity. It has been decoupled from Velocity and is being used
           in the XO mapper (see below). Once this code is cleaned up it can
           definitely be reused in Velocity.
         </li>
         
<li>
           JCS: This is the new caching system that we plan to use
           in all the Turbine projects. The package is maintained by
           Aaron Smuts and you can find a bit out about it
           <a href="http://jpolycache.sourceforge.net" class="externalLink">here</a>. Aaron
           has started documenting JCS and we'll get some comprehensive
           documentation up soon as I'm sure many people will be very
           interested in this package.
         </li>
         
<li>
           Lifecycle: These are interfaces that we are starting to use
           in the Turbine code to provide a consistent way of dealing
           with various components like Torque and Fulcrum. By having
           Torque and Fulcrum implement these new lifecycle interfaces
           and teaching Turbine to deal with these interfaces we provide
           a new mechanism whereby any component can be made a subsystem
           very easily. So for example you could easily make
           <a href="http://objectbridge.sourceforge.net" class="externalLink">ObjectBridge</a>
           a subsystem for use in Turbine by providing a small wrapper
           that implements the lifecycle interfaces.
         </li>
         
<li>
           Pool: This is essentially the PoolService refactored into
           a component. Done so for the exact same reason the FactoryService
           was turned into a component.
         </li>
         
<li>
           Resources: This package is a reworking of the resources package
           found in Velocity. The Velocity specifics have been removed and
           hopefully this package will provide facilities for full resource
           management.
         </li>
         
<li>
           XO: This is currently an XML -&gt; Bean mapper that takes an XML file
           formatted in a common way and maps the content to a Java Bean.
           Basically, this allows us to simply design our Bean, and
           provided that the commons XML format is used no mapping rules
           need to be created. The testbed has full examples, and the
           Turbine 3.x pipeline descriptors are mapped using the XO
           package. Again, we're working on full documentation though
           the JavaDoc is fairly comprehensive.
         </li>
       </p>

     <section><a id="Using_DVSL_for_Documentation"></a>
<h1>Using DVSL for Documentation</h1>
       
<p>
         <a href="http://velocity.apache.org/dvsl/devel/" class="externalLink">DVSL</a> is now
         being used for the Turbine 3.x documentation as it is more flexible
         and will allow the generation of PDF documents. Work was started in
         the Velocity repository that transformed the xdocs into FOP documents
         so I have started from that work to try and produce a good set of
         PDF docs.
       </p>
     </section>

     <section><a id="New_Security_Model"></a>
<h1>New Security Model</h1>
       
<p>
         Gonzalo and Eric are currently working on some ideas for a new
         security model for Turbine 3.x. Anyone can view the work being
         done by looking at the <b>rundata_security_changes</b> branch
         in the <b>jakarta-turbine-3</b> repository.
       </p>
     </section>

     <section><a id="RunData_Reworking"></a>
<h1>RunData Reworking</h1>
       
<p>
         I am currently reworking the RunData system so that it can be
         decoupled from Fulcrum and generally work in a more flexible manner.
         We want to be able to use multiple variants of RunData in an
         application, and we want each of those variants to house a
         configurable set of tools: a cookie parser or a parameter parser
         for example. This work needs to be finished before the security
         models can be tried and tested. Hopefully the RunData work will
         be finished next week sometime.
       </p>
     </section>

     <section><a id="Turbine_3.x_Pipeline"></a>
<h1>Turbine 3.x Pipeline</h1>
       
<p>
         The Pipeline in Turbine 3.x is now fully functional. Some
         documentation on the pipeline has been created and it will be posted to
         the site this weekend. The upshot of this change is that we now have
         configurable request processing so an application can tailor its
         pipeline(s) very easily to meet any requirements.
       </p>
     </section>

     <section><a id="Introduction_of_Cactus"></a>
<h1>Introduction of Cactus</h1>
       
<p>
         The use of Cactus was introduced in the Turbine 3.x tree so that
         changes can be tested easily. Jeff has also backported our
         Cactus based testing framework to the 2.x branch. This is a
         big step forward for us as we had virtually no testing
         prior to this addition. Thanks a ton to Jeff for getting
         this working!
       </p>
     </section>

     <section><a id="More_Consistent_Build_Pattern"></a>
<h1>More Consistent Build Pattern</h1>
       
<p>
         The build systems for Turbine 3.x, Turbine 2.x, Fulcrum, Torque
         and Flux are all now basically the same. There is a new target
         in each of the respective build files that will allow you to
         download the JARs necessary for building the project. The TDK
         has also been outfitted with this feature so developers interested
         in helping improve the TDK can do so without having to hunt down
         all the necessary JAR files. We hope that the addition of the JAR
         downloader will help make it easier for people to participate
         without having to build everything under the sun.
